# Crowd Behavior Study via CARLA

### Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify;">This study aims to evaluate the physiological impacts of interacting with drivers exhibiting varying behaviors on an individual operating a vehicle within a simulated environment. We will collect biometric data from the individual. In this way, we will assess how stressed an individual is in varying conditions. Specific behaviors will be modeled in the simulation, including aggressive drivers whose presence is hypothesized to increase the stress level of the individual driving. Behaviors of aggressive drivers will include but are not limited to, speeding, frequent lane changes, tailgating, etc. The primary objective is to assess whether and how the social dynamics of road interactions influence a driverâ€™s physiological responses. Furthermore, this research will investigate how environmental factors such as the weather and the speed limit will separately and in combination with one another affect the physiological responses of the driver. The findings are expected to provide insights into how different driving scenarios can be stress-inducing, thereby affecting the overall traffic flow and safety of the system.</div><br>
